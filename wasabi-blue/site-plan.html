      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
      Hi, I’m a Web Developer. I create clean and structured websites that promote your business. A well-designed site not only provides your potential customers with valuable information but also can create a brand that helps identify you among the sea of websites. A well designed internet site can keep your existing customers up to date on all your latest info but also attract new visitors to find out more about you and your business. Think about one of your favorite, non-social media, websites. What draws you there? The design? The content? The owner? Think if we could get these same things working for you. Wouldn’t it be worth investing in yourself and your business to be the owner of a site like this?

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        My intended audience are those small business owners who want to get started with putting their business online and seek new customers. First time business owners who are not sure where to start or how to get online but know that they need to put their company or product online and not just one a social media marketplace or advertise on social media only. Ages from 19 and up who have a service or product they want to reach a larger audience and also have a more professional appearance and feel than just social media.

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

        Color Palette

      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/4484CE-D9D9D9-F9CF00-F19F4D" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/4484CE-D9D9D9-F9CF00-F19F4D</a>

      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Poiret One  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        Clean and elegant look while still readable. Stands apart from the paragraph font and is simple and easy on the eyes.  <!-- change this -->

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Nanum Myeongjo  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        Compliments the paragraph font and is easy to read in large paragraphs or small sentences. Adds a bit of refinement but not too fancy.  <!-- change this -->

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        My intended audience would be people seeking services of a web developer to build them a site for their business. Mainly targeting small business owners or people who are not sure where to start when trying to launch their idea for a business venture. There are people who are trying to get their idea off the ground and are searching for a way to put their products or services out on the internet in a more professional manner than just creating a social media page and posting pictures.
	While this may be part of what is incorporated into their website, this is not the only way to out themselves ‘out there’. The social media platforms can reach a wide array of people with varying interest and curiosities. However, most social media platforms are not equipped to provide all the necessary material to potential customers to inform them and display the full range of goods and services that a business owner offers. Also, keeping current customers apprised of new products and services is also necessary and can get lost on a social media platform. Social media can provide an introduction and a preview, but there needs to be a place customers can go to get the full spectrum offered items and their descriptions.
	This is where my website comes in. This website will be the place where these small business owners can come to see what web developer services are offered. They can get a sense of the types of services and maybe pricing.

        The homepage would display some contact info, so that doesn’t need it’s own page. There would also be a bit of description, most likely a summary or a variant of what was stated in the previous section of this page. Images might show some technical, designed images, maybe a couple of office type people with a computer displayed. Maybe even a scene from nature to provide a bit of contrast to the technical imagery already displayed.

        One child page will be a form to fill out if wanting to setup an appointment to meet for consultation. Potential customer will provide name, contact info including phone number and email address, and a description area to provide a bit of an idea of the type of business or idea they would like to get started online.

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        Another child page I have a couple ideas floating around. One idea is to provide a sample page of what a potential customer might be able to see. This would get the customer thinking about what style elements they might like, what images they might use, what text or descriptions they might like to see on their pages.
	Another idea for the 2nd child page might be a list of the features and deliverables that are provided if they were to hire me as their web developer. Some content could include security features, email service, analytics, database and server services offered, and more. Might also show prices per hour. A section for Frequently Asked Questions might also be added here, or might be it’s own page, thought a sample of FAQ’s might be a good start here.
